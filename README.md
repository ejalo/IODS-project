# About the project

## Learning objectives

The aim of this course (Introduction to Open Data Science) is to get familiar with open software tools (such as R, RStudio, RMarkdown and GitHub). During this course I will learn also how to apply certain statistical methods using these tools.

## How these objectives are achieved?

The main idea of this course is learn by doing. Each week I complete a new assignment. These assignment are peer reviewed, so I will learn also from other students. The course can be completed online, but I may also attend weekly lectures to work together with other students and receive advice from teachers if needed.
