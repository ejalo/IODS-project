## Learning objectives of the course

During the course I will learn about three themes:

1. How to use open data sets from different sources **(Open data)**
2. How to share my own data, code and results using openly available software tools **(Open Science)**
3. How to apply certain statistical methods **(Data Science)**

## My personal thoughts about the course at the beginning

My main motivation to attend the course was to learn more about R and how to use it for analysing and visualising the data. It took me a while to understand how this course works, but now when I have got started I'm quite excited. It looks like I'm goint to learn a lot.
